# Grammar-Corrector

## Introduction

Grammar-Corrector is an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to correct grammar and typos in English written sentences. It leverages the power of the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model developed by Google. T5 is a state-of-the-art generative model trained on massive amounts of text data, capable of generating human-like text given a prompt or input.

## Key Features

- **Grammar Correction**: Grammar-Corrector employs the T5 model to identify and correct grammar errors in English sentences.
- **Typo Correction**: The system also corrects typos and misspellings, enhancing the overall accuracy and readability of the text.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Utilizes a transformer-based architecture with attention mechanisms to process and understand the context of sentences effectively.
- **Fill-in-the-Blank Training Objective**: The T5 model is trained using a "fill-in-the-blank" objective, enabling it to generate text that fits seamlessly into a given context.

## Model Fine-Tuning
For those seeking even greater performance, consider fine-tuning the T5 model on domain-specific data to tailor its capabilities to specific text types or use cases.
